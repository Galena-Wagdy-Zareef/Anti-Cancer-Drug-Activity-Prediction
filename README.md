**Anti-Cancer Activity Prediction: Neural Network Tuning**

Welcome to the Anti-Cancer Activity Prediction project where cutting-edge data science techniques converge with bioinformatics to forecast the potential of chemical compounds against non-small cell lung cancer.

**Project Overview:**

This competition challenges you to predict the anti-cancer activity of chemical compounds represented as graphs. Each atom is a node and bonds are edges. Positive/negative outcomes are defined for non-small cell lung cancer.

**Key Tasks:**

1. **Meme Competition**: Share a favorite meme related to data science, adding a touch of fun to the challenge.

2. **Understanding the Template**: Comment extensively on each code line, demonstrating comprehension of the provided template. Explain the experimental protocol, hyper-parameter tuning, search space, and criteria for evaluating hyper-parameters.

3. **Problem Formulation**: Define the input, output, required data mining function, challenges, and impact. Envision an ideal solution.

4. **Model Tuning and Documentation**: Improve model performance using a structured data science lifecycle. Experiment with features, hyperparameters, and models. Record reasons, expectations, and outcomes for each attempt.

5. **Graph Convolution Mechanisms**: Tune at least three aggregation mechanisms for the graph convolution layer, providing insightful justifications.

6. **Up-Sampling**: Address class imbalance by adapting training data preparation for up-sampling the positive class samples.

**Answer the Questions:**

🌈 Describe the SDF file format.

🌈 Explain the meaning and dimensions of input tensors to the neural network model.

🌈 Define the symbolism of each dimension of gnn_out and avg tensors.

🌈 Differentiate between segment_mean and tf.reduce_mean. Interpret the meaning of each dimension of the pred tensor.

🌈 Explore the motivation for employing multiple GCN layers compared to just one, along with the number of layers used in the template.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

👍 Technical Soundness: Ensure correct implementation and reasonable hyper-parameter tuning.

👍 Documentation Quality: Provide clear, organized explanations for design adjustments.

👍 Code Clarity: Comment comprehensively on the template and new code.

👍 Requirement Fulfillment: Cover all specified tasks in at least 10 trials.

👍 Question Responses: Accurately address the provided questions.
